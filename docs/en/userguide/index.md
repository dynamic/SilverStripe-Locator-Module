# User Guide

Create a Locator page in the CMS. Enabling Auto Geocode will return the 26 nearest locations to that user's current location. If not enabled, all locations will be shown on the map.

You can also filter locations by one or more categories. This is useful if you'd like to have multiple Locators in a site with different locations on each map.

Locations are managed under the Locations tab in the CMS via Model Admin. Simply enter the name and address of each location, and the coordinates will be generated on save.

Those locations marked as `ShowInLocator` will display on the map, per your Locator page settings.
